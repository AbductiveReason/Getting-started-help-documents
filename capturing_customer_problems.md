# How to Capture Customer Problems

AbductiveReason uses the Problem Description Language framework to capture customer problems. You should read the blog post <a href="https://abductivereason.io/blog/problem_description_language/">Problem Description Language: A framework to stay customer focused</a> for a broader understanding.

Problem Description Language is a non-domain specific business readable description of a customer problem. Problem Description Language re-frames solutions and feature request as problems to be solved for. It may or may not include the persona that is exhibiting the problem, and may provide beneficial context when included.

Problem descriptions are composed of three parts:

<b>Problems</b> are framed as <i>"How can I..."</i> questions.

<b>Personas</b> refers to the persons that have the problem and are better understood when they are researched and defined within your product management framework.

<b>Processes</b> are any action or series of actions that must be completed to achive an outcome. These are most commonly business process activities.

### Problem Description Language



| Problem   | Persona  | Process  |
| :-----------: | :-------------:     |:-------------:    |
| How can I      | as a product manager      | track user problems? |

### Examples

- <b>"How can I avoid having to retype the same information in different forms?"</b>

You might capture this problem if you received a feature request to automatically fill in fields on forms.

- <b>"How can I as a systems analyst perform faster queries?"</b>.

 You might capture this problem if you received a feature request to <i>"increase the performance time of queries</i>.

The goal is to re-frame a solution oriented request or feature to speak directly to a problem that you can capture evidence about.

#### Hint
Try breaking complex user problems down into multiple problems.
